Ocufy, is an Augmented Reality application that enables healthcare providers to quickly and seamlessly access patient notes, diagnoses, and information in real-time using facial recognition and tracking. By instantaneously recalling and logging patient data, Ocufy reduces the time that healthcare providers spend using electronic health records, which helps lower physicians’ and nurse practitioners’ burnout rates, stress levels, and dissatisfaction. This efficiency also provides patients with extra time to consult their attending physician(s), increasing accessibility and potentially decreasing the cost of medical care.
We prioritize security, privacy, and above all, easy integration so that we don't trouble the user in any way. This revolutionary technology can greatly decrease burnout and increase time spent on actually treating patients.
